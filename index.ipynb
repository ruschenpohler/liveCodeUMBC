    "\n",
    "We will model, program, and simulate a simple example of consumer demand. First, we need some theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a consumer that chooses between two goods $x$ and $y$. The prices of the two goods are\n",
    "$p_{x}$ and $p_{y}$. The consumer has a total income of $I$ to spend on these two goods. Finally,\n",
    "the consumer gets `utility` or happiness from consuming these goods. Here is their utility function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U\\left(x,y\\right) \\equiv x^{a} \\cdot y^{1-a}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from this example, the utilty function has several standard features. It is increasing\n",
    "in each argument, $x$ and $y$. The more, the merrier. Also, the `marginal utility` of each good, i.e.\n",
    "the additional utility from consuming another unit, is diminishing. The first unit of a good \n",
    "has a greater impact on utilty than the 10th good.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now present the `consumer demand problem`. The consumer will choose an amount of $x$ and $y$\n",
    "to maximize utility, while staying within their `budget constraint`. That is, they solve:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\max_{x,y} x^{a} \\cdot y^{1-a} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{such that } p_{x}x + p_{y}y = I\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you solve for the optimal $x$ and $y$? \\[Hint: you can use the Lagrange method.\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing some simple constrained optimization, we have the following `demand functions`:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "x(p_{x}) &=& \\frac{aI}{p_{x}} \\\\\n",
    "y(p_{y}) &=& \\frac{(1-a)I}{p_{y}} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can verify yourself that these levels of demand do satisfy the budget set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we will model this consumer, their choices, and then graph their choices over a variety\n",
    "of price levels, i.e. we will draw a demand curve."
